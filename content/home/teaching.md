_"Professor Jung is incredibly passionate about this subject and helped me cultivate a deep and vibrant understanding of Chinese  politics. She values discussion and a variety of view points in class and helps foster student growth and participation. She has  been one of the most encouraging professors to me personally this semester!" (Student Evalulation, Spring 2023, POL 4680)_


_"Professor Jung was amazing. She was constantly engaging and enthusiastic. She created a very positive class environment. She  was also really understanding and receptive to any suggestions or clarifications. She also took the time to answer our questions  and get to know us as individuals. 10/10 would recommend this course to others and  specifically a thank you to Professor Jung!"
